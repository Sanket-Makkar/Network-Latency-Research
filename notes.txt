Description:    This is a file to contains notes regarding the CSDS325 proj5 assignment

1) You can access the data.txt file at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKfBuJNdGk7xcmEp2DizT7EX7L6DPX9r/view?usp=sharing
* note that this should be universally accessible given the link to anyone at CWRU
* this is all the data I collected for this assignment

2) To run data gathering for 2500 points you can execute: python3 datagathering.py
* To change the number of data points you must manuall enter the python script and update its NUM_WEBSITES parameter to your desired number of hosts

3) I analyze the data using a jupyter notebook named dataparsing.ipynb.
To analyze the data, observing graphs and metrics, open dataparsing.ipynb.
For the basic class definitions that analyze and parse data, after having run data gathering and generated a data.txt file, please run the first cell.
To instantiate the data anlyzing class, and pass it the parsed data, please execute the next cell.
To observe insight one's metrics and graph please execute the next cell.
To observe insight two's metrics and graph please execute the next cell.
To observe insight three's metrics and graph please execute the next cell.
To observe insight four's metrics and graph please execute the next cell.
To observe insight five's metrics and graph please execute the next cell.

* Note that I utilize a few libraries in the jupyter notebook that are common but not installed with python by default - I believe these libraries are okay to use but the dependencies are just something to be aware of.
* These libraries are numpy, and matplotlib
* If you do not have these dependencies installed, please pip install each (pip install numpy) (pip install matplotlib)

4) I have included tranco-20241115.csv in this tarball for the sake of allowing the script to function.
